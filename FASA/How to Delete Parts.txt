Folders are broken up by program, Delete the program you do not want.  Its best to delete entire folders as some parts have dependencies for re-use of textures.
If you just want the part gone without any memory savings you can always just delete that parts .cfg file.

Ex. If you dont want the ICBM parts delete the ICBM folder.


-Do not delete These Folders - Unless You Know What You Are Doing
Plugins (Unless you do NOT want reflections on some parts)
Props (IVA props for LEM and RPM)
Resources (Contains the science def for Science)
